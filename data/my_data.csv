Youtube got upset people disliked the video and removed the dislike button.,
"People of the future: this has 3M likes, 20M dislikes. Never forget",

3.1Mn Like   20Mn Dislike:face-fuchsia-tongue-out:,
Is there a reason why people hate this video so much? Like 1 million dislikes please tell me why people hate this video.,
Yea,
Because it's Corporate Garbage,
 well summarized,
"Because it didn't represent in any kind of way what the youtube in the year of 2018 was, that was the objective... So it was just a stupid joke, irrelevant people that no one cared about.",
looking back my opinion has not changed,
This is the most disliked video in YouTube,
"3.1 million likes, yay! 20 million dislikes",
This is why YouTube removed dislikes,
"Fr, they were mad that Rewind 2018 was bad",
20 million dislikes... that's wild,
"2nd May, 2024 :  3,159,625 likes VS 20,423,229  Still one of the biggest cringiest, wokest, trash rubbish videos ever created. And since my comment 2 months ago - there's been 8,748 likes vs 56,551 dislikes.",
so this is why youtube removed dislikes,
"sorry this aint gonna be the most disliked video no more, its gonna be karma by jojo siwa.",

After this YouTube was never the same,
"Wait, so what was wrong with the 2018 Rewind and why did it get so many dislikes?",

Not trying to be rude at all but you look pretty young in your PFP. This was a different time on youtube with its own special era of drama going on. You kinda had to be there to understand the hate.,
 that's my cousin..,
at the time this was goofy asf,
 yh but..,
"._--_1 It was never that bad, people are just... people.",
 I'd rather this than 2023 and 2024,

"3.1M likes, 20M dislikes. Yeesh.",
This is what happens when you don't ask your viewers to like and subscribe,
"YouTube probably removed dislikes because of this. (20,426,985 dislikes on this video)",
Why the heck are people hating on this! Its just a fun time when we can come together at the end of the year and just watch something fun! Even if their favorite YouTuber isnt in here they shouldnt get so angry about it and just appreciate it because they took the effort to get all these creators together!,
Is that the most hated video?,
" ""guys let's do the in my feelings challenge""",
20 M ! (-dislikes),

"oh yeah, youtube cringefest",
This was genuinely so dissapointing for its time :(,
"Fun fact: this video was completely scripted.  We never got to control rewind, rewind controlled us.",
Ok it aint that bad,
No wonder why this the most hated video on YouTube,
Lol,
2024  Yall lets stop the hate because its awesome,
No way this is getting nostalgic ,
"20 Million dislikes as of now, shame that the public is unable to see it without using extensions and other shenanigans",
Fire,
"Kinda interesting how they included content farms and people who were known to have ""cheese pizza"" in this ",
Its funny in the battle bus!?,
2024  CONGRATS EVERYONE  WE MADE IT TO 20M DISLIKES!,
Can someone please tell me why this is the most disliked YouTube video? Like is there any particular reason or something??,
"Because it didn't represent in any kind of way what the youtube in the year of 2018 was, that was the objective... So it was just a stupid joke, irrelevant people that no one cared about.",
"3.1M Likes, 20M Dislikes.",
Why do people hate this?,
Yeah?,
It was cringe at the time and it still is. It shows how little to no care Youtube gives to its community and audience.,
You werent there,
"Because it didn't represent in any kind of way what the youtube in the year of 2018 was, that was the objective... So it was just a stupid joke, irrelevant people that no one cared about.",
Cool rewind,
It got really cringey by the halfway mark,
the reason people like this video is the fact it isn't disliked too much,
"The year that made the world become what it is now, SAD",
20m dislikes.. MORE THEN JOJO SIWA :0,
Never let will smith cook again,
bring back dislike,
 is where the odd1sout comes in,
Yo is Drake really about to break this dislike record ,
People here in 2024  ,
YouTube if you see this you owe James he brought back rewind and so should you you owe him about 500k. Thats not my choice tho,
how does this have more dislikes than likes tho???,
Because it absolutely f-ing sucked,
Man id rather have something like this instead of nothing...,
Imagine if Rewind 2023 existed and it's just skibidi toilet and pure brainrot,
Anyone in 2024?,
Most disliked video on yt is yt this video,
Team Nick Eh 30 carried the video     ,
Horrible video ,

Really misses the point of youtube rewind. It's to celebrate the content creators and popular culture. Went back and watched 2012 and 2013 and it was filled with joy and silliness. This just missed the point.,
